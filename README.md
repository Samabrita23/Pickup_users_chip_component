# Pick Users Chip Component

A chip component to add users designed using Typescript and React.

## Features:

1. Input Field Interaction: Clicking on the input field displays a list of items.
2. Dynamic Filtering: As you type, the list dynamically filters to show only items that match what you're typing.
3. Item Selection: Clicking on an item turns it into a chip at the top, and the input field adjusts automatically.
4. Chip Management: Once an item becomes a chip, it is removed from the list. Each chip has an "X" icon, clicking which removes the chip and adds the item back to the list.
